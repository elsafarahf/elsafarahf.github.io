								<p><p>A good design in facilities and infrastructure will encourage to increase the performance and quality of the university. The development of Information and Communication Technology is growing rapidly, various high-tech products are mass-produced which enable humans to work more effectively and efficiently. For instance, the influence of using social media for students and staff in Universiti Utara Malaysia. The students use social media as a platform for doing many activities such as bonding relations, finding lost contact, and for discussing common interest. Therefore, the use of social media as a platform for online reporting is very important. Nowadays, smart reporting application already released to facilitate access for students and staff to report. <p>
Using social media for reports, the application uses hashtag to classify the theme or topic being discussed and upload various photos into a basic platform for application development with an orientation on how students and staff can easily report problems encountered in the surrounding environment along with photo evidence and their location points. The reports submitted are not only in written form but should accompanied by photos. In the other side, this application also has a feature to be able to discuss among users.<p>
 	Therefore, this project will focus on designing and building a mobile application to capture the product design failure via picture or screenshot. The Dart Programming Language and Flutter as IDE are used to build this application. The objective of this project is, first it facilitates access for students and staff to report directly and quickly. Second, students and staff can engage and exchange ideas with others about product design failure so that they can find solutions to problems.
